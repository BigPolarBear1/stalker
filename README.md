# stalker

Uploading the emails from my stalker who has been harassing me for 7 years.
He's someone from eastern Canada (Quebec city area) and Ive seen one of his twitter accounts harass other people in infosec too, and other people seem to know who this guy is. So logging his activity again. This type of shit shouldnt go without consequences for 7 years..
